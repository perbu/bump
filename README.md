# bump

A simple tool to bump version numbers in git. Written as replacement for standard-version, which is deprecated.


## What it does

bump starts out by reading all the tags from git. It will discard everything that doesn't look like a version
number (v1.2.3, 1.2.3, 1.2.3-alpha.1, etc). It will then sort the versions and pick the highest one. If there are no
tags, it will fail.

It will then increment ("bump") the version number according to the command line arguments. If no arguments are given
it will default to bumping the patch version.

It will then look for files name `.version`. If any such files are found in the reposity their content will be
replaced with the new version number.

These files will then be added to git and committed with a message that includes the new version number. bump will try
to access the ssh-agent to sign the commit.

Finally, it will create a new tag in git with the bumped version number.
